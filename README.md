# terraform-oci-arch-drupal

These is Terraform module that deploys [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) on [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)](https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/cloud-infrastructure).

## About
Drupal is one of the most popular content management systems (CMS) available. It is free and open-source, released under the GNU Public License.

Drupal is based on the LAMP stack and provides users and enterprises a scalable and robust architecture, low implementation and maintenance efforts, as well as a large community-led knowledge base. Its setup and usage does not require advanced technical skills. It provides the infrastructure for websites worldwideâ€”ranging from personal blogs to corporate, political, and government sites. It is very extensible and modular, making it useful in a large variety of scenarios.

## Prerequisites
1. Download and install Terraform (v1.0 or later)
2. Download and install the OCI Terraform Provider (v4.4.0 or later)
3. Export OCI credentials. (this refer to the https://github.com/oracle/terraform-provider-oci )


## What's a Module?
A Module is a canonical, reusable, best-practices definition for how to run a single piece of infrastructure, such as a database or server cluster. Each Module is created using Terraform, and includes automated tests, examples, and documentation. It is maintained both by the open source community and companies that provide commercial support.
Instead of figuring out the details of how to run a piece of infrastructure from scratch, you can reuse existing code that has been proven in production. And instead of maintaining all that infrastructure code yourself, you can leverage the work of the Module community to pick up infrastructure improvements through a version number bump.

## How to use this Module
This Module has the following folder structure:
* [root](): This folder contains a root module.
* [examples](examples): This folder contains examples of how to use the module:
  - [Drupal single-node + network deployed by module](examples/drupal-single-no-existing-network): This is an example of how to use the oci-arch-drupal module to deploy Drupal (single-node) with MDS and network cloud infrastrucutre elements deployed within the body of the module.
  - [Drupal multi-node + custom network injected into module](examples/drupal-ha-mds-use-existing-network): This is an example of how to use the oci-arch-drupal module to deploy Drupal HA (multi-node) with MDS and network cloud infrastrucutre elements deployed with network cloud infrastrucutre elements will be injected into the module.
  
To deploy Drupal using this Module with minimal effort use this:

```hcl
module "oci-arch-drupal" {
  source                        = "github.com/oracle-devrel/terraform-oci-arch-drupal"
  tenancy_ocid                  = "<tenancy_ocid>"
  user_ocid                     = "<user_ocid>"
  fingerprint                   = "<finger_print>"
  private_key_path              = "<private_key_path>"
  region                        = "<oci_region>"
  compartment_ocid              = "<compartment_ocid>"
  admin_password                = "<MySQL_admin_password>"
  drupal_password               = "<Drupal_user_password>"
  numberOfNodes                 = 1 
}
```

Argument | Description
--- | ---
compartment_ocid | Compartment's OCID where OKE will be created
use_existing_vcn | If you want to inject already exisitng VCN then you need to set the value to TRUE.
vcn_cidr | If use_existing_vcn is set to FALSE then you can define VCN CIDR block and then it will used to create VCN within the module.
vcn_id | If use_existing_vcn is set to TRUE then you can pass VCN OCID and module will use it to create Drupal installation.
numberOfNodes | If you need HA configuration with LB and FSS then set the value to 2 or more.
drupal_subnet_id | The OCID of the drupal public (single node) and private (multi node) subnet access. 
lb_subnet_id | The OCID of the Load Balancer subnet in multi node configuration.
bastion_subnet_id | The OCID of the Bastion subnet in multi node configuration.
fss_subnet_id | The OCID of the File Storage Service subnet in multi node configuration. 
availability_domain_name | The Availability Domain for deployment.
display_name | The name of the Drupal instance. 
shape | Instance shape to use for Drupal node.
flex_shape_ocpus | If shape is set to Flex shape then you can define Flex Shape OCPUs.
flex_shape_memory | If shape is set to Flex shape then you can define Flex Shape Memory (GB).
lb_shape | Load Balancer shape
flex_lb_min_shape | Load Balancer shape minimum shape when lb_shape=flexible
flex_lb_max_shape | Load Balancer shape maximum shape when lb_shape=flexible
use_bastion_service | If you want to use OCI Bastion Service then you need to set the value to TRUE.
bastion_service_region | If use_bastion_service is set to TRUE then you can define bastion service region. 
bastion_image_id | If use_bastion_service is set to FALSE then you can define Bastion VM image id. 
bastion_shape | If use_bastion_service is set to FALSE then you can define Bastion VM shape.
bastion_flex_shape_ocpus | If use_bastion_service is set to FALSE and bastion_shape is using Flex shapes then you can define Flex Shape OCPUs.
bastion_flex_shape_memory | If use_bastion_service is set to FALSE and bastion_shape is using Flex shapes then you can define Flex Shape Memory (GB).
use_shared_storage | If numberOfNodes set to 2 or more then you can use shared NFS on OCI FSS (value TRUE). If you want to replicate Drupal by yourself (for example with rsync) then you can you can set the value to FALSE.
drupal_shared_working_dir | If numberOfNodes set to 2 or more then you can define shared mountpoint name.
label_prefix | To create unique identifier for multiple clusters in a compartment.
